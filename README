2023 MESSAGE:
i don't know why i stopped developing this game, probably because it was a pain in the ass to use unity 2018 but i'll see if i'll redevelop this game ever again
i think i will. it was pretty fun because i started knowing a few lines of code while making this game, now i know a lot of c# and lua/LUAU so i guess i'll redevelop it
